# LeetCode Algorithm Solutions

This repository documents my solutions to LeetCode problems as I prepare for technical interviews. Each solution is written in Python and organized by topic.

## Problem Index

| #    | Title                    | Solution                     | Difficulty |

| 1768 | Merge Strings Alternately | [Python](./algorithms/strings/merge_strings_alternately.py) | Easy       |
| 412 | Fizz Buzz | [Python](./algorithms/arrays/fizz_buzz.py) | Easy       |
| 1071 | Greatest Common Divisor of Strings | [Python](./algorithms/strings/greatest_common_divisor_of_strings.py) | Easy  |


## Folder Naming Conventions

- **algorithms/** – Root for all solution files
- **arrays/**, **strings/**, **trees/** – Topic-based folders
- File name = snake_case version of the problem title
